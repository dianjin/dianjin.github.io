Hi! Welcome to my blog!

Here are some subjects I'm curious about:

* Functional programming
* Web development
* How to make programming fun and accessible to newcomers
* Things not related to programming?

Here's my history with programming:

* Early 2000s: Neopets HTML shenanigans
* Early 2010s: Visual Basic and Java in high school
* 2014: Started my undergrad studying computer science at UWaterloo
* 2015: Interned at DBRS (Angular)
* 2016: Interned at Hootsuite (React) and Yelp (Python)
* 2016: Discovered functional programming

Thanks for reading!
